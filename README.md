# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

This project enables users to enter inputs via inquirer prompts in order to generate a logo via SVG images, saved into our examples folder as "logo.svg". This project is an example showcasing my alility to further utilize inquirer to take in user input and use that data to give a simple, effective, easy to use command line application. Creating this project was also a nice segway into the different functionalities and uses of SVG imagery.
